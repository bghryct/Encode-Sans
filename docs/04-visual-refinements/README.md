# Visual Refinements

Like any other design project, Encode Sans has been evolved and refined over time. As good as the current version is, there are a few opportunities to make it just a little more harmonious of a design. 

Jacques Le Bailly (@fonthausen) is in NYC this week, so I took the opportunity to consult with him about a few possible changes. It was a great opportunity to understand the logic behind some of the design decisions, and to quick sketch ideas together for improvements.

## Uppercase German Double S (áºž, Unicode 1E9E)

As of October, 2016, the `/Germandbls` had a form that was relatively unique for this glyph. I asked a couple of German friends in type design, and they agreed that it looked out-of-place.

Talking with Jacques, he expressed that it should keep some of the top curvature present in letters of Encode Sans, like `/B` and `/R`. 

My first effort wasn't quite feeling right ... it was maybe a little overly-sharp at the top.

I looked for further design guidance in sources such as the [Proposal to encode Latin Capital Letter Sharp S to the UCS](http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3227.pdf), a [Medium article from Christoph Koeberlin](https://medium.com/@typefacts/the-german-capital-letter-eszett-e0936c1388f8), and [design suggestions from Ralf Herrmann](https://typography.guru/journal/capital-sharp-s-designs/).


I started to see that I could keep the left part of Encode's original `/Germandbls`  so as to not make it overly-blocky. I could also borrow the top right corner of the `/Z` to make sure it followed the overall construction logic of the typeface. I feel that this form is fitting in quite well. It still needs a bit more tweaking to feel really finalized, but I like how it's looking:

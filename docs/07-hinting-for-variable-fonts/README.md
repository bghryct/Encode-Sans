# Hinting for Variable (and static) Fonts

## Questions for Micah Stupak-Hahn, Nov 27, 2018

### What hinting process do you currently recommend for a VF? Do you expect this to change soon?

### I assume I can ignore FontBakery tests `062` (GASP) & `072` (PREP) in a VF. Is this correct?

### Should I run `gftools fix-nonhinting` script, or skip this? I've heard it's only for display fonts...

### Is it better to export static fonts from GlyphsApp, or via FontMake w/ the `--autohint` flag?

### How might I check whether I've done autohinting properly?

# Working through FontBakery Issues

Some of the FontBakery `FAIL`s and `WARN`s are pretty self-explanatory, so I'll just fix them (e.g. "WARN: Name table strings must not contain the string 'Reserved Font Name'."). Others will take a bit more doing, so I'll document the process here.

## Reserved Font Name

I was at first confused why this continued to warn me, after changing it in the GlyphsApp source. Turns out, the "Reserved Font Name" line was coming from `scripts/NAMEpatch.xml`.

## Caret positions for ligatures

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN: Are there caret positions declared for every ligature?

Using [my simple glyphs script](https://github.com/thundernixon/glyphs_scripts/blob/master/add-caret-anchors.py) to make this a bit faster and more fun.

## Kerning non-ligated sequences

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN: Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?
> com.google.fonts/check/065
> 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
> 
> f + i
> i + j
> j + l
> [code: lacks-kern-info]

Do they all need kerning? It helps to look at what the ligatures *are* in the design. The `f_j` and `f_i` ligatures have an `f` which has a shorter top "hook," to avoid a clash between the `f` and the `i`/`j` dot. So, the `/f/i` combination understandably uses positive kerning to also prevent a clash. I matched the `/f/j` combination to it.

I'm confused why FontBakery is advising me to check `j + l` ... I can't find that ligature anywhere in this typeface, and it isn't a very logical ligature for these shapes, anyway. There *is* an `l_j` ligature (for some reason...), but this seems to be somehow getting reverse by FontBakery.

üéâ (I've fixed what is worth fixing.)


## OTS Sanitize

> * üî• FAIL: ots-sanitize returned an error code (1). Output follows:
> 
> ERROR: GDEF: bad caret value format: 3
> ERROR: GDEF: Invalid ligature caret list
> ERROR: GDEF: Failed to parse table
> Failed to sanitize file!

- [x] find where the caret value is coming from ... maybe there's an accidental duplication of a `caret_1` in a ligature? Start by looking at the GDEF table.

On line 170 of [ots/src/gdef.cc](https://github.com/khaledhosny/ots/blob/63f8d7e47cf9ab75a25b2b63bb359349fef050fa/src/gdef.cc), there is the following comment:

>       // TODO(bashi): We only support caret value format 1 and 2 for now
>       // because there are no fonts which contain caret value format 3
>       // as far as we investigated.

However, in the TTX of my variable font, I have `<CaretValue index="0" Format="3">` for each caret description in the `<LigCaretList>` table. 

On [MS Docs for the GDEF table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/otspec140/gdef#ligature-caret-list-table), it says:

> One format represents values in design units only, another fine-tunes a value based on a designated contour point, and the third uses a Device table to adjust values at specific font sizes.

I am simply using the built in GlyphsApp recommendation for inserting caret positions, as described on page 27 of the [Glyphs Handbook](https://glyphsapp.com/downloads/handbook/Glyphs-Handbook-2.3.pdf). So, I'm guessing that if my exported variable font is getting `format 3` either from GlyphsApp or from FontMake's VF exporting.
